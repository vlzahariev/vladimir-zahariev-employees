# vladimir-zahariev-employees

This is my project on the task for Sirma Solutions.

It receive a .csv file in certain format as an input and populate in the front end a table with the employees worked the longest on the same project.

The test.csv file were used for testing the output.

The application should be able to receive different date formats.
If there is no populated "DateTo", it accept that the employee is still working on the project.
